Place your local images here and reference them using `/images/<filename>` in the Add Property Image URL or in the seed data.

Example:
- Copy the file `adam-winger-A4U4dEuN-hw-unsplash (1).jpg` into this folder and rename it to `studio.jpg`.
- Then the URL to use in the app is `/images/studio.jpg`.

This folder is served statically by Vite under the project root.
