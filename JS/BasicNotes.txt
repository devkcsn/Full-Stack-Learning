JS BASIC NOTES

- let var cons

these are the keywords in which we can store any variable with its value.


	let manish; ES6 {}	scope local
	var manish; ES5 func	scope global
	const manish;		scope local

- What is hoisting ?

let ab = 45;

console.log(ab); 45

todegi aise:  

console log(ab);

ES - ECMA Script 

a is not defined is an error
undefined is a value

-- Concatenation is a kind of typecast, which says that we can write different datatype together by using '+' . 
Eg - if we want to print a string and variable of same or different datatype as well.
	let str = "hello" ;
	let num = 10;
	console.log(str + " World " + num );

What is browser context API?
its basically gives us 3 features 
- window object
- heap memory 
- stack

JS has mainly 2 versions a) ES5 and b) ES6
