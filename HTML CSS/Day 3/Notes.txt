Units of CSS

px - pixel (1920*1080)

16 px = 1 rem (widely used)
percentage (widely used)


viewport -- How much things is seen at a capture (when seen is open how much site is visible)

vh - viewport height (widely used) --> The height visible in the screen.
vw - viewport width (widely used) --> The width visible in the screen.

Our Pc screen is in 4th Quadrant of graph.

margin --> Space between elements. 
Padding --> Spacing inside the element.

---------------------------------
open code editor from cmd ---> code . 
:: To select path in explorer press alt + d ::

----------------------------------

percentage take the value from the parent and if parent do not have height and width i.e, it is a div then the child height in percentage 
is also 0.

---------------------------------

By defaut the margin is 8 px and maybe some padding is also available.
so we write boiler plate to remove them and create a raw website.

---------------------------------
What border box exactly do is when we give padding or margin to a box their may chances of increasing and decreasing the 
size of box so to fix the size of box we use border-sizing : border box.

---------------------------------

Positions

Absolute Position --> Uplift the position of box in z axis so the place becomes vacant and other div can take that place.
example - Think about a chair on the ground and we are lifting that chair to a certain height, upon lifting their is a gap between chair and 
ground and in that gap other element can be placed.


** when we put absolute to a child instead of considering its parent as parent its considering body as parent (entire webpage). So while using 
percentage as height and weight we need to consider that.

Relative Position --> Applies on parent. Tells its child about their parent, so when position absolute applies on child it 
always be inside its parent instead of bypassing its parent.
